<p> This week aI am <em> extremely </em> excited about a
  new cooking technique called <dfn> <i> sous vide </i><dfn>. In <i> sous vide
  </i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually a vacuum-sealed in plastic) into
  a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In
his book, <cite> Cooking for Geeks </cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>
  ultra-low-temperature poaching</q>. </p>

<p> Next month, we will be serving <b> Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise </b>.
  To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30. </p>
