        <h1> Low and Slow </h1>
        <p> This week I am <em> extremely </em>excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn> sous vide.</dfn> In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vaccum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature
            you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite> Cooking for Geeks </cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q> </p>
        <p> Next month, we will be serving <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill
  Hollandaise.</strong> To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us
            <em> <strong> before November 30. </strong> </em> </p>

        <p> <em>Warning:</em> Sous vide cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues. </p>
