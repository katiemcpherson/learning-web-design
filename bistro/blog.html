                <p> This week aI am <em> extremely </em> excited about a new cooking technique called <em> sous vide </em>. In <em> sous vide
  </em> cooking, you submerge the food (usually a vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, <cite> Cooking for Geeks </cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>
  ultra-low-temperature poaching</q>.
                </p>

                <p> Next month, we will be serving <strong> Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise </strong>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30. </p>
